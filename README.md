# 🎸 String Meter

**String Meter** is a safe, intuitive guitar tuner designed for everyone — even those who don't know note names or pitch frequencies.  
It allows you to tune accurately and confidently without fear of breaking strings.

## 🌟 Features
- **No pitch knowledge needed** – visually guided tuning for all levels.  
- **Safe tuning** – reduces the risk of string breakage by warning when tension is too high.  
- **Responsive and simple** – lightweight design that works smoothly on both desktop and mobile.  
- **No installation required** – runs directly in your browser using your device’s microphone.

## 🔧 How It Works
String Meter analyzes sound through your microphone and visualizes pitch stability as a vertical bar.  
When the bar reaches the correct zone, your string is in tune — it’s that simple.
